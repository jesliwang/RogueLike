# Entitas 2D Roguelike

This is simple post apocalyptic roguelike game written for the [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) engine.
This project is a ground up rewrite of the [Unity 2D Roguelike Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial)
architected to use [Entitas](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp).
Entitas is an Entity Component System which allows projects to be architected in a clean and extendable manner.

## Rationale

Unity is a powerful tool for game creation but leaves something to be desired in
terms of code architecture. Looking for a better way to organize and architect my
code I found [Entitas](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp). Eager to test
it out, I rewrote one the standard Unity example projects in it. I am hoping this
code will serve as an example on how to use and convert existing project to
Entitas and demonstrate the Entity Component System style of architecture.

## Entity Component System

Entity Component System (ECS) is an architectural pattern for game development that
allows for a high degree of flexibility and maintainability.

I gave a talk on ECS at a game developer meetup:
